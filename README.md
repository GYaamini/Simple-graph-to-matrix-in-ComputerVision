# Simple-graph-to-matrix-in-ComputerVision
The goal is to take the image of a handwritten simple graph and extract the adjacency matrix and incidence matrix of the same
Few things to note in the code:
1. Vertices are identified by English uppercase letters
2. Vertices are colored in Red and Edges are colored in Blue for identification

# Stages of implementation
